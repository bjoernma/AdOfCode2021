# AdOfCode2021

My versions of possible solutions of the Advent of Code 2021. If you have any possible improvements, please feel free to add :) This repo is also a bit of a script and tool collection for me.

# Day 1
I just wanted to try some things with awk again. The trick seemed to be to load data list into an array. All the interesting stuff happens in the END statement.

# Day 2
This day more about python3. Just load the data into a list and add the values accordingly...
